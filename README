About this program.

Xpress API Client.  Short of needing this for work, it has zero value to anyone else that doesn't use the Varolii API.

Requirememnts.
Python 2.7
My forked version of Requests(Kenneth Reitz) - https://github.com/tpe11etier/requests


How to use:
 - First, you must install the module I mention above.
 - Once you do that, you should be able to run the python interpreter and do "import requests".  If that fails, you
   did something wrong.
 - The oemclient will read from the included properties file which has 3 attributes.
        - url (Any valid Varolii url will work)
        - file (specify an XML file you want to run.  The file *must* be places in the xmlfiles directory)
            *Note* - You may also specify None and it will run the embedded XML.
        - charset (I don't do any validation here, but not specifying one will work as well)
 - Success messages as well as failures will be written to oemclient.log
